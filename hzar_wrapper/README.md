## HZAR - WRAPPER

1. hzar_clines_analysis_parallel.R - wrapper to fit geographic clines with hzar package using multiple cores; it also automatically gathers the best model and all needed parameters

## IMPORTANT

Although widely used, the 'hzar' package is no longer (and has never really been) supported by developers after its release. There are serious issues with the installation on the newest versions of R (>= 4.0.0). This code was developed and tested on R 3.6.3. Make sure you use the proper R version before reporting the issues.
