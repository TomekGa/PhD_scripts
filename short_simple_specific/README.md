2. aln_to_fasta_converter.py - Converts text file with aligned sequences (.aln extention) into standard fasta
3. consensus.R - Provides consensus sequence for provided sequences
4. Dealing_with_big_tables.R - the instruction how to use SQLLite and corresponding R packages to deal with big tables which cannot be read into RAM memory
5. decompress_parallel.R - simple wrapper to decompress multiple big files (e.g. fastq) in parallel.
